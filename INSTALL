* Compilation and Installation

  In any shell type the following:

  $ tar -xjf libgaminggear-X.X.X.tar.bz2
  $ cd libgaminggear-X.X.X
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr" ..
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

  * optional cmake entries you can set with -D:

    * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE         If you want useful debug information in case of
      errors use Debug. Default is Release.

    * INSTALL_CMAKE_MODULESDIR If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for cmake modules, you can set it manually. Normally it's /usr/share/cmake/Modules.

    * INSTALL_LIBDIR           If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for libraries, you can set it manually. For 64bit systems that's normally
      $PREFIX/lib64 but Ubuntu uses $PREFIX/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/.

    * INSTALL_PKGCONFIGDIR     If cmake doesn't find the right install directory
      for pkg-config, you can set it manually. Normally it's /usr/share/pkgconfig
      or /usr/lib*/pkgconfig.

    * UINPUTDIR                If cmake doesn't find the right location of the
      uinput device, you can set it manually. Autodetection needs module uinput
      loaded. Normally it's in /dev or /dev/input.
      
    * WITH_DOC                 Set this to TRUE if you want to build the API
      documentation.

  * It is strongly recommended to install everything in /usr instead of the default
    directory /usr/local.

* Finishing steps

  * Refresh the icon cache

    Call the command

    $ sudo touch --no-create /usr/share/icons/hicolor

    where /usr has to be substituted with your install prefix.
